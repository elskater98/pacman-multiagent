# Pacman Berkeley

For the first assignment, you have to work on the "PacMan" project. In particular, you must implement the following algorithms:

- [ ] Mini-Max (iterative): 2.5 points

- [x] Alpha-Beta (recursive): 2.5 points

- [x] Expectimax (recursive): 2.5 points

- [x] Evaluation function: 2.5 points

As an optional task, you can develop the iterative version of the Alpha-Beta algorithm.

You can find all the required materials under the "lab" folder in the virtual campus, and you will have to deliver the whole "PacMan" project with all its files (modified, unmodified and added) as a .zip file.

This assignment can be done individually or in groups of two students.
